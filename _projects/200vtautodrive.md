I was a member of the VT AutoDrive team during my senior year of college, which was the first year of the team. I lead the "Sensing" team which handled car localization and utilizing car information off the CAN bus. In the later half of my year with the team, I worked on the PID control of the car's speed based off of navigation parameters.
