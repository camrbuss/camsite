My name is Cameron Buss and I am an Engineer that studied Mechanical Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). I grew up a mere 7 blocks away from the Virginia Tech campus in the quaint but rapidly growing town of Blacksburg. My life is divided between time with family, manual labor at the family farm, rock climbing, and my engineering endeavors.

Checkout my [Timeline]({{ "/timeline/" | prepend : site.baseurl }}) page for a little bit about my major life events, but the highlight of this website is my projects. My [projects page]({{ "/" | prepend : site.baseurl }}) lists some of the creations I have made in the past, and below is a list of projects that I would like to take on in the near future:

- Tall Bike (Two bike frames stacked on top of each other)
- Brushless motor driven CNC laser cutter
- My Father’s 1967 Mustang Restoration
- Embedded device using LoRa for data collection
- Shipping Container house with off the grid Solar Power
- Inverted Pendulumn stabilzation with a Kalman Filter for measuring angle

This is more of a personal list, but the following are some adventures that I would like to go on before I am 30:

- [Cerro Fitz Roy](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112532641/supercanaleta) in Patagonia
- [Moonlight Butress](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105717718/the-moonlight-buttress-clean-aid) in Zion National Park
- [El Capitan - Zodiac](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106152347/zodiac) in Yosemite National Park
- Putting up my own route in [Bozoo, WV](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106442164/bozoo)
- Bike a long distance with Yudi Ko on a tandem bike

Don’t hesitate to contact me with any comments, questions, or suggestions.
